description: What packages and libraries to use for specific tasks inside of codebase
globs: *.tsx, *.ts

- Use tailwind, when choosing colors choose `neutral` ones i.e `bg-neutral-200`, support darkmode.
- For handling dates always use "dateFns"
- Use Zod for validation where applicable
- If you need animations use framer-motion. You can import it like this: import { AnimatePresence, m } from "motion/react";
- You can use lodash if that will significantly reduce complexity. I will import it myself.
- Always use arrow functions
- Always export react components like `export const SomeComponent = () => {}` even in single component files.
- Use shadcn components, they are located in `"@shad/components"`
- For icons always use Lucide. Prefer imports suffixed with icon. I.e. `import { CalendarIcon } from "lucide-react"
